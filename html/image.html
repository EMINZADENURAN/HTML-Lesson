      The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average
      distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), about 30 times Earth's diameter. The
      Moon always presents the same side to Earth, because gravitational pull
      has locked its rotation to the planet. This results in the lunar day of
      29.5 Earth days matching the lunar month. The Moon's gravitational pull –
      and to a lesser extent the Sun's – are the main drivers of the tides. The
      Moon is in geophysical terms a planetary-mass object or satellite planet.
      It has a mass that amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is
      roughly one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474 km (2,159 mi) about as wide
      as Australia.[17] Within the Solar System it is the most massive and
      largest satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive
      and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf
      planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half
      of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's moon Io the second highest among all
      Solar System moons. The body of the Moon is differentiated and
      terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic
      field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation,
      out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized
      Mars-sized body called Theia. The lunar surface is covered in lunar dust
      and marked by mountains, impact craters, their ejecta, ray-like streaks
      and, mostly on the near side of the Moon, by dark maria ("seas"), which
      are plains of cooled magma. These maria were formed when molten lava
      flowed into ancient impact basins. The Moon is, beside when passing
      through Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by the
      Sun, but from Earth the visible illumination shifts during its orbit,
      producing the lunar phases.[19] The Moon is the brightest celestial object
      in Earth's night sky. This is mainly due to its large angular diameter,
      while the reflectance of the lunar surface is comparable to that of
      asphalt. The apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing
      it to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse. From
      Earth about 59% of the lunar surface is visible over time due to cyclical
      shifts in perspective (libration), making parts of the far side of the
      Moon visible.

      For humans the Moon has been an important source of inspiration and
      knowledge, having been crucial to cosmography, mythology, religion, art,
      time keeping, natural science, and spaceflight. On September 13, 1959, the
      first human-made object to reach an extraterrestrial body arrived on the
      Moon, the Soviet Union's Luna 2 impactor. In 1966, the Moon became the
      first extraterrestrial body where soft landings and orbital insertions
      were achieved. On July 20, 1969, humans for the first time landed on the
      Moon and any extraterrestrial body, at Mare Tranquillitatis with the
      lander Eagle of the United States' Apollo 11 mission. Five more crews were
      sent between then and 1972, each with two men landing on the surface. The
      longest stay was 75 hours by the Apollo 17 crew. Since then, exploration
      of the Moon has continued robotically with crewed missions being planned
      to return beginning in the late 2020s. The usual English proper name for
      Earth's natural satellite is simply Moon, with a capital M.[20][21] The
      noun moon is derived from Old English mōna, which (like all its Germanic
      cognates) stems from Proto-Germanic *mēnōn,[22] which in turn comes from
      Proto-Indo-European *mēnsis "month"[23] (from earlier *mēnōt, genitive
      *mēneses) which may be related to the verb "measure" (of time).[24]

      Occasionally, the name Luna /ˈluːnə/ is used in scientific writing[25] and
      especially in science fiction to distinguish the Earth's moon from others,
      while in poetry "Luna" has been used to denote personification of the
      Moon.[26] Cynthia /ˈsɪnθiə/ is another poetic name, though rare, for the
      Moon personified as a goddess,[27] while Selene /səˈliːniː/ (literally
      "Moon") is the Greek goddess of the Moon. The English adjective pertaining
      to the Moon is "lunar", derived from the Latin word for the Moon, lūna.
      Selenian /səliːniən/[28] is an adjective used to describe the Moon as a
      world, rather than as a celestial object,[29] but its use is rare. It is
      derived from σελήνη selēnē, the Greek word for the Moon, and its cognate
      selenic was originally a rare synonym[30] but now nearly always refers to
      the chemical element selenium.[31] The element name selenium and the
      prefix seleno- (as in selenography, the study of the physical features of
      the Moon) come from this Greek word.[32][33] The Greek goddess of the
      wilderness and the hunt, Artemis, equated with the Roman Diana, one of
      whose symbols was the Moon and who was often regarded as the goddess of
      the Moon, was also called Cynthia, from her legendary birthplace on Mount
      Cynthus.[34] These names – Luna, Cynthia and Selene – are reflected in
      technical terms for lunar orbits such as apolune, pericynthion and
      selenocentric
